# Fresh_Start
Helping new grads find their start

The intention of this app originally was to pull in job information, rental information, as well as leisure activities for a certain area.
As of 10/15/2017, the supported functionality exists solely for job information:
* Users enter their desired job title, and we find locations where that job title is most in-demand
* The app uses the CareerJet API

In future iterations, they will be able to look at available accommodations, as well as leisure activities for a given location.
