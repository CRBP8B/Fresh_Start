# Fresh_Start
Helping new grads find their start

The intention of this app originally was to pull in job information, rental information, as well as leisure activities for a certain area.
As of 10/15/2017, the supported functionality exists solely for job information

Current workflow:
* Users enter their desired job title
* We find locations where that job title is most in-demand, using the CareerJet API
* App parses the JSON results, and returns cities which have 10 or more matching job listings

In future iterations, they will be able to look at available accommodations, as well as leisure activities for a given location.
